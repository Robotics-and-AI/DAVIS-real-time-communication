## Introduction

Data output of event-based sensors is high-frequency and extremely lightweight, with only 8 bytes per event.

To evaluate the hypothesis of using event cameras as data source for a real-time robotic system, this repository contributes with code to capture and send event camera data through UDP.

## Requirements

- A <a href="https://docs.inivation.com/_static/hardware_guides/davis240.pdf">DAVIS240C event camera</a> - to obtain the data
- The <a href="http://jaerproject.org">jAER open-source software</a> - to display and record the data
